# Project_6_Feminism
This is repository containing a spreadsheet of respondents answers. The purpose of this project was to collect data and share it for my statistics class.
The questionnaire was anonymous, and all answers are used for academic purposes only. All participants' responses were kept confidential, and their privacy was protected. Each volunateer also consesnted to their data being collected and shared. The questions were associated with three types of feminism and how the respondent felt about each one on a scale of 1-10. 1 strongly disagreeing and 10 strongly agreeing.
